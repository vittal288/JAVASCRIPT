About ME:
Your intrapersonal intelligence dominates your brain. You are extremely self-aware and reflective. You have a strong moral compass and passionate opinions on what you believe is right or wrong. You constantly contemplate life on a deeper level and take pride in expressing yourself through creative processes. 

This means that you also have very high levels of linguistic and existentialist intelligence. You see life through a more intense lens than many people and this allows you to create meaningful relationships in your personal and professional life.
