Post the business meeting with client , we have to implement those changes as per the dates. 
We are near to release date of the projet.

--> Why you cannot conduct the business meeting over the Video Conference.
I have to meet the diffrent stake holders from two different place(New York and New Jersy) and vendors(Splunk of tool).
it is very to difficult to get the slot with them over the VC. It is good meet the client for business meeting than over the VC, because direct meeting will build the trust.

   We are near to release dates of the project, if I dont go there , it will impact on the release dates and hence it may impact on the Loreal business.
   

Why not someone from New Jersey or New York?
I have joined this project in the very beginning and I have an idea of end to end landscape of the project.
